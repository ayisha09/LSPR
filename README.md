## Overview
The Large-Scale Pedestrian Retrieval Competition (LSPRC) mainly focuses on person retrieval which is an important end application in intelligent vision system of surveillance. Person retrieval aims at searching the interested target with specific visual attributes or images. The low image quality, various camera viewpoints, large pose variations and occlusions in real scenes make it a challenge problem.

By providing large-scale surveillance data in real scene and standard evaluation methods that are closer to real application, the competition aims to improve the robust of related algorithms and further meet the complicated situations in real application. LSPRC includes two kinds of tasks, i.e., Attribute based Pedestrian Retrieval (PR-A) and Re-IDentification (ReID) based Pedestrian Retrieval (PR-ID). The normal evaluation index, i.e., mean Average Precision (mAP), is used to measure the performances of the two tasks under various scale, pose and occlusion. While the method of system evaluation is introduced to evaluate the person retrieval system in which the related algorithms of the two tasks are integrated into a large-scale video parsing platform (named ISEE) combing with algorithm of pedestrian detection.

The competition is hold in Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision in 2018 (PRCV2018) and attract more than thirty institutions to participate. This report gives a brief analysis and conclusion on the competition results which may help researchers to develop more robust algorithms.

Please refer to the file "LSPRC.pdf" for more details on the evaluation results and ralated summarization.
